Implementation of the DistMesh algorithm for Processing language.
===


## Dependencies
1. This sketch was tested in Processing IDE versions 3.3.6, 3.3.7 and 3.4.
2. For properly working, this sketch requires the [giCentreUtils](https://www.gicentre.net/utils) library to be installed beforehand in 
Processing IDE. To do this, go to `Sketch` -> `Import Library...` -> `Add Library...` menu. Then select from the list of available libraries or enter the word `gicentre` in `Search` field (the one with the small zooming glass).

## How to use
1. Install [Processing IDE](www.processing.org) by downloading its newest version for your particular operating system from [here](https://www.processing.org/download/) and extracting the content of the downloaded archive in any place of your choice.

There are lots of explanations about how to [get started](https://www.processing.org/tutorials/), using the [Processing IDE](https://www.processing.org/reference/environment/) and the broad range of its [libraries](https://www.processing.org/reference/libraries/).
2. Clone this [repository](https://github.com/ivanshuba/DistMeshProcessing) from Github or simply download and extract the repository in any place on your computer.
3. Go inside the DistMesh folder.
4. Double click the DistMesh.pde file. This will launch the Processing evironment and open this project inside IDE (Processing editor). 
5. To run the sketch:
   - press "Run" button (at the top left corner of the Processing IDE gui);
    or
